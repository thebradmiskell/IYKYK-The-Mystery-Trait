# Sui Foundation Builder Grant Portfolio: IYKYK: The Mystery Trait 

## Executive Summary: Pioneering Proof-of-IYKYK on Sui   

**IYKYK: The Mystery Trait** is a gamified, collectible NFT project (7,777 pieces) that transforms holders into subculture sleuths. Our core innovation is **Proof-of-IYKYK**, a decentralized, on-chain reputation system built on Sui for tracking and verifying community-driven cultural knowledge.   

The project leverages Sui’s core capabilities to deliver mass adoption: 

* **Dynamic Utility:** The NFTs are dynamic in-game assets. Each trait is minted with a coded name, and a holder may have an advantage if their NFT contains the day's Mystery Trait. This game-based system, which uses verifiable on-chain assets and a public reveal of the trait's real name, is a novel use of Sui's object model for community-driven knowledge tracking.
* **Web2 Onboarding:** Our focus is on seamless onboarding using Sui features like **zkLogin and sponsored transactions** to reach a billion new users who don't yet have a wallet. 
* **Gaming Focus:** The project spans comics, original music, and interactive experiences, aligning with Sui’s strength as the leading gaming blockchain.   

## Our Proof of Commitment & Execution   

As the IP Creator (Brad Miskell), my focus is on content, community, and the unique cultural vision of the project. My "proof of work" and long-term commitment include: 

* **Detailed IP Development:** Years of work leading to the full Hot Wing & A Prayer universe, comics, and original musical score. 
* **Explainer Video:** A detailed foundational asset video (link below). This demonstrates a proven ability to deliver complex assets and marketing materials. 
* **Founder Commitment:** As a 68-year-old founder with a background in writing and art, my dedication to building a long-term IP is a key differentiator. This project is rooted in creative world-building, not quick speculation.
