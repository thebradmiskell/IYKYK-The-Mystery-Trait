# Hot Wing & A Prayer: IP Showcase and Proof of Execution

This document provides evidence of the Hot Wing & A Prayer universe's creative depth, demonstrating the founder's commitment and execution across multiple media platforms.

## Founder's Commitment (Brad Miskell)

As a 68-year-old founder, my dedication to building a long-term, multi-media IP is a key differentiator, rooted in creative world-building following a serious personal health scare [cite: 2025-08-27]. My 'proof of work' is evidenced by the detailed assets below:

## 1. The Explainer Video

This video was created at Gemini's suggestion to serve as the most important fundraising asset, detailing the vision for "Hot Wing & A Prayer: IYKYK" and the **Proof-of-IYKYK** concept [cite: 2025-08-27].

## 2. The Comics (The Core Narrative)

The IYKYK game is based on the expansive narrative of the Hot Wing & A Prayer universe, which began with the **SNATCHED! The Genesis-ing** digital comic.

* **Status:** Full 26-page digital comic completed (pending final polish).
* **Sample Pages:** [INSERT LINKS TO 2-3 SAMPLE PAGES OR A LOW-RES PDF HERE]
* **Art Style:** The same irreverent, satirical style seen in the NFT collection.

## 3. The Music (Original Score)

The IP includes original, recorded music that is integrated into the narrative and available for promotional use.

* **Status:** Original songs have been written, recorded, and are part of the HWAP lore [cite: 2025-08-27].
* **Sample Track:** [INSERT LINK TO A SOUNDCLOUD/YOUTUBE MUSIC TRACK HERE]

## 4. The NFT Collection (IYKYK: The Mystery Trait)

The 7,777 NFT collection is the gamified access point to the IP.

* **Key Design:** Each NFT features unique "Mystery Traits" (nearly 200 traits in total) that reference obscure global cultures, niche pop culture, and Web3 insider nods to foster a genuine "IYKYK" sense of community.
